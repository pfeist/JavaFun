JavaFun
=======

This is a collection of three Java exercises I have done recently between work and school.  FizzBuzz is my solution to the Fizz Buzz programming challenge.  FunCoding was a simple program I created with the purpose of reversing a string of text.  When I finished FunCoding I realized it would be more interesting if it allowed user input, and decided to try making the same program again but with a GUI, which became GUI Build.  

Thanks for checking my stuff out,

Phil
